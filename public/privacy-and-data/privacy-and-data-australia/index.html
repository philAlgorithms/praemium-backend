<p><strong>Why do we collect and hold this information?</strong></p>
<p>Praemium collects or holds information in order to provide our services to you, or to enable your adviser to perform various functions and services on your behalf.  We are also required by law to conduct customer due diligence checks under the <em>Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006</em> (Cth) (“AML/CTF Act”). Praemium cannot provide services to you, or your adviser unless this information is collected.</p>
<h4><strong>Dealing with personal information</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Using your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Personal information is required to enable us to provide our products and services, including for these purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To verify your identification</li>
<li>To assess or process your application for a product or service</li>
<li>To perform administrative and operational tasks</li>
<li>Providing you with products and services, and any updates to these</li>
<li>To consider any complaints you may raise</li>
<li>To manage risks, and prevent or investigate suspected or actual fraud misconduct or unlawful activity; and</li>
<li>To comply with laws such as the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em> (Cth), AML/CTF Act, Australian taxation law and the Privacy Act.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />We may disclose personal information we collect with other entities within the Praemium group and with third parties for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting our Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence requirements</li>
<li>Collecting overdue payments</li>
<li>Providing information to any third-party service providers we engage</li>
<li>Providing marketing material; and</li>
<li>External complaint resolution schemes. <br /> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sharing of personal information overseas</strong></p>
<p>For data backup purposes, your data may be hosted and stored in facilities that may be located overseas.</p>
<p>We may disclose your information to related overseas entities for the purpose of providing internal support for our service and product offerings.</p>
<p>In addition, the disclosure is required or permitted by law. For example, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and Common Reporting Standards (CRS) requires Praemium to collect and provide information about foreign investors who have investments in our SMA. This is lodged with the Australian Tax Office which may ultimately pass over to the US Government’s Internal Revenue Service or the relevant foreign tax authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping personal information secure</strong></p>
<p>Personal information that is collected by Praemium may be stored electronically, or in hard copy form. It may be held directly by Praemium, or by a service provider which Praemium has engaged to provide services.</p>
<p>Praemium has implemented processes and systems to ensure personal information is protected from misuse, interference, loss or unauthorised access by ensuring:</p>
<ul>
<li>All transmitted data is encrypted on secure networks.</li>
<li>Firewalls, intrusion detection systems and anti-malware/anti-virus tools.</li>
<li>Physical security measures are in place, including cameras and smartcards.</li>
<li>Staff training, policies and procedures (including clean desk).</li>
<li>We only keep information as long as we are legally bound to and use secure destruction processes.</li>
<li>We destroy or de-identify any unsolicited information.</li>
<li>Database access is controlled, and third-party agreements reflect privacy obligations.</li>
<li>Internal access to client records and databases is restricted based on an employee’s roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li>Authorisation processes are in place for changes in access</li>
<li>Client records in hard copy format are secured and archived where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note however that Praemium cannot be responsible for user access that an Adviser may permit or manage.</p>
<p>In the event you believe your privacy has been compromised, please contact your Adviser first. However, if you believe your privacy has been compromised by an action undertaken by Praemium, you can contact our Client Services Team at any time by contacting <a href="../../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="abd8dedbdbc4d9dfebdbd9cacec6c2dec685c8c4c685cade">[email&#160;protected]</a> or on 1800 571 881.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing your personal data</strong></p>
<p>In most cases, individuals who have provided personal information to Praemium are entitled to access that information or request their information be updated at any time.  </p>
<p>Praemium will respond to your request for access to the personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made.  We reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover our costs. There are a few exemptions, including cases where legal proceedings are taking place, or providing access may be unlawful, or if providing access would pose a threat to other people’s privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your information up to date</strong></p>
<p>Praemium relies on the accuracy of the personal information provided to us by you. We aim to ensure that it is accurate, up-to-date and complete. We have created appropriate system access for your Adviser to keep your personal information accurate and up to date. For non-SMA products, your Adviser may also grant you access to update your data. If any of your details change you can also contact our Client Services Team. </p>
<p><strong>Data Breach Response</strong></p>
<p>Should any unforeseeable event occur which results in the loss, or unauthorised access or disclosure of your personal information, Praemium has processes and mechanisms in place to contain any breach, determine any impact and comply with any applicable notification laws.  In the event that it is likely to result in serious harm to you, we will investigate the matter and notify you and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner pursuant to our obligations under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p><strong>Retention of personal information</strong></p>
<p>In most cases personal information will be retained for seven years after the cessation of Praemium’s dealings with a person. In cases where Praemium is no longer required to maintain records, personal or sensitive information held by Praemium will be de-identified or securely destroyed.</p>
